# Predicting Football Match Outcome using Machine Learning

I have used dataset from two sites for this project
1.https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer  
2.http://football-data.co.uk/data.php  

The dataset from kaggle website was in sqlite format but I was not able to upload the file in sqlite so i have uploaded the csv files for all the tables.

This dataset has tables of Country, League, Match, Player, Player Attributes, Team ,Team Attributes and sequences. It has information of more than 25000 matches, 10000 players, 11 European Countries with their lead championship from 2008 to 2016, Players and Teams attributes sourced from EA Sports' FIFA video game series, betting odds from up to 10 providers

I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis and used this dataset for it.

Later I have downloaded data from the football-data.co.uk website which had even more relevant information which i have used to perform prediction.

I have performed Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms on the dataset with SVM giving the highest accuracy of 61.29%
